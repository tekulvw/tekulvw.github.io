## Hello!

I'll be creating and updating this website with semi interesting stuff as I come up with it. Hopefully this will turn into a bit of a resume and a bit of a blog as time goes.

### Project List
These projects are things I'm actively working on, take a look, contact me on Discord and feel free to ask about anything!

* [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/CogCreators/Red-DiscordBot) - A Python project that I joined really early on and have been working on since January of 2015. See my thoughts about the experience on [this page](RED.md).

* [FIRST Tech Challenge](FTC.md)
