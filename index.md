Hello! I am Will Tekulve, a current undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
Most of my life has been spent being involved in competitive robotics through the [FIRST robotics program](https://www.firstinspires.org/) where I have spent 5 years competing in FLL, 3 in FTC, and 5 years mentoring and coaching across the nation while traveling on co-op.
These experiences have given me a deep interest in automation, in both pure software and more of a mix of soft and hardware like controls engineering.

### Picture going here

I am currently planning to graduate in the spring of 2020 and am looking for opportunities for full time employment post graduation. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me at the information provided below.
