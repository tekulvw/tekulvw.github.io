## Red-DiscordBot

So I really love this project and the community that's evolved from it. I started my Python career with the Limnoria IRC bot project in 2009 learning to write plugins and now I'm back to bot development for the Discord platform.

I think it's pretty safe to say that Red has evolved into the largest open source Discord bot available and for very good reason. Just like Limnoria, it's designed around the principle that anyone can develop new content for it and that anyone should be able to easily run their own instance.
