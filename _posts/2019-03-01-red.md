Back in 2012 I got my start learning Python through a project called [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) on IRC.
Limnoria is a piece of bot software that allows its' owner to create or install plugins which contain commands that arbitrary users can execute on a connected IRC server.
This modularity allows users to extend the functionality of the base project to do basically anything you could think of.

I thought this was *awesome*.

Programming in general can be considered as an attempt make a machine do what you, as a programmer want.
The machine will do, without fail, exactly what you tell it to and the only limit is your imagination and creativity.
Getting started with programming, I felt working with a bot to be one of the best possible options because it allows you to see and interact with the code you write instantly.
The feedback loop of write, test, trial, fix is extremely apparent and it happens in quick succession right in front of your eyes.
