For my second and third co-op terms I spent time in Greenville, North Carolina working at Patheon.
Patheon, now a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, runs a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant there and I chose to work there to gain some experience working in controls engineering.
I wanted to use this experience as a stepping stone towards applying to work at Tesla.

After I arrived in North Carolina I was assigned to work with the steriles automation team.
They maintained the PLCs (programmable logic controller) which ran the machines on the steriles production lines for the entire building.
These machines produced sterile medicine for injection, including the vial sterilization, filling, and capping processes.
