Red is an open source and highly modular bot for the Discord communications platform that I have been working on since early 2016.
It started as a simple project with a few features and a large opportunity for expansion.
I pushed the project into it's latest version, got it onto PyPi, simplified the installation process, and started the core developer team.
This team now has 5 members from all over the world and we work together to continue to push updates on a regular basis.

The project has evolved into something much bigger than any of us on the core developers team had ever imagined.
We currently have 7,000 users on our support server, 1.2K stars on Github, and a few thousand monthly downloads of our latest version.

We also partner closely with some of the largest servers on Discord (over 300K users) as they use our bot software to help moderate their users.
