I spent the Fall semester of 2018 working at Tesla's Gigafactory 1 plant in Sparks, Nevada for my fourth co-op term.
Gigafactory 1 is a massive plant Tesla constructed in the High Sierra deserts where they work in conjunction with Panasonic to produce multiple products for Tesla Motors and Tesla Energy.
My time there was spent working on the Model 3 Drive Unit and Battery Pack manufacturing lines.
