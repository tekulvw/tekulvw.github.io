I started my co-op career at UC with Kinetic Vision, a Cincinnati local engineering firm that does a large variety of work.
At this time I was only majoring in Computer Science and I was placed into the Virtual Reality team.
This team used Unity and the HTC Vive with SteamVR to create Virtual Reality demos of everything from medical devices to airplanes.
As part of these projects I also gained experience the Google Cloud infrastructure, using AppEngine and DataStore to create a user login system for one of the VR demos.

At KV I worked a lot on professional communication.
I was able to run a lot of my own projects but that meant I had to keep good lines of communication open with the people designing the assets for the VR demos as well as my managers who were interacting directly with clients.
This ensured we were able to create the features that clients requested in a timely manner and we were also able to ensure that the final product met our standards for quality and functionality.
